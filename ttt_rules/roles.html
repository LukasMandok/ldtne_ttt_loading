				<td valign="top"><p>The beacon is an innocent who becomes more powerful each time someone on their team is confirmed dead. How they are buffed is determined by a series of convars, but by default consists of minor improvements to a slew of stats, including: jump power, speed, damage resistance, damage, fire rate, and health regeneration.<br>
				<br>
				If they accrue enough power, they literally light up and their role is revealed to everyone. This makes them as trustworthy as a detective, but will also alert antagonists to their growing power.<br>
				<br>
				There is but one catch: The beacon mustn't kill someone on their team. If they do, they will become an innocent, and take (potentially lethal) damage. Furthermore, an innocent killer can never become a beacon (ex. an amnesiac who kills the beacon in an attempt to inherit their powers). Such a person becomes an innocent instead.</p>

				The amount of roles that the clairvoyant can see can be set with a convar.<br>
				<br>
				Additionally in combination with the sidekick and the jester, they can kill the jester as the only player without receiving a penalty or triggering the jesters winstate! After their death, the jester will immediately respawn as a sidekick of the clairvoyant.</p>

		<br>
		The ankh is a precious item. When the pharaoh dies, he will be once revived at the position of his ankh. However his adversary, the graverobber, is able to steal this artefact from him. He has to be careful to not draw any attention on himself or he might show his true role to the other players. If the ankh is in the posession of the graverobber, he gets revived instead of the pharaoh upon death.<br>

Additionally, while holding Devour, the Glutton's movement speed and sprint regeneration increase based on how low their hunger is.<br>
				When the Glutton deals damage or eats a corpse with Devour, they regain health and they refill a portion of their hunger bar, always staving off starving! If the Glutton's hunger drops to zero, they will soon turn into the Ravenous! </p>

				<td valign="top"><p>The marker plays in his own team and has the goal of marking other players with his fancy paintgun. Once he marked enough of them (by default 3/4 of all players except himself) he wins. Marked players get notified when they are marked, so they do know there's a marker active in this round (you can disable that). The marker can't win by killing people in fact by default he can't even deal any damage and he always looses when only he and maximal one other role is alive. Therefore he plays nicely alongside the jester, since then there are two roles that do not deal any damage, one of which should be killed and one shouldn't. If he's too slow with marking other players, he might be unable to mark enough of them. Once all markers are dead, all players are unmarked! Players that were marked but killed afterwards do not count to marked players.<br>
				<br>
				Additionally the marker sees in a special UI element how many players he has to mark. And since this number is scaled by the number of players that are alive, he can get a sense of how many players are still alive. This gives him some interesting powers, but he should keep quiet about them because calling out that someone has died might reveal him. Marked players do not deal any damage at all to him and he wears a body armor to protect himself.<br>
				<br>
				The marker spawns with a marker defi that allows him to revive dead players. Revived players keep their role but spawn as marked. Since nobody knows if he is a traitor, a survivalist or a marker he can confuse others really fast.</p>
